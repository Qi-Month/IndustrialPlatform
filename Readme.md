This mod allows players to place an industrial platform which automatically fits the chunks of Minecraft game.

Place it to the places you want to place a platform, and rightclick it with cobblestone, cobbled deepslate or andesite

Rightclicking with a cobblestone releases an 1x1 chunk platform, and it fills the 5 blocks below automatically.

Rightclicking with an andesite releases an 1x1 chunk levitational platform, it fills nothing above or below, but is double-layered.

Rightclicking with a cobbled deepslate releases a 3x3 chunk platform with everything else the same like the cobblestone one.
